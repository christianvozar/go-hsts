# HSTS

```Go
import "github.com/christianvozar/hsts"
```

Package hsts provides a handler function for Go that applies a web security policy mechanism to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

The HSTS specification was published as [RFC 6797](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6797) on 19 November 2012 after being approved on 2 October 2012 by the IESG for publication as a Proposed Standard RFC.[3] The authors originally submitted it as an Internet-Draft on 17 June 2010. With the conversion to an Internet-Draft, the specification name was altered from "Strict Transport Security" (STS) to "HTTP Strict Transport Security", because the specification applies only to HTTP.[4] The HTTP response header field defined in the HSTS specification however remains named "Strict-Transport-Security".
